                            Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, 
                            typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. 
                            The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. 
                            Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience
                            The specific place of the performance is also named by the word "theatre" as derived 
                            from the Ancient Greek θέατρον (théatron, "a place for viewing"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, "to see", "to watch", "to observe")
